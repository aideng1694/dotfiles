ZSH
  [ ] Add ZSH Support
    Using Oh My Zsh (https://ohmyz.sh/)

BASH
  [ ] Add Functions directory and have a seperate file per function.
    This would use a file that source'd all the functions

    [ ] Seperate functions into seperate files
    [ ] Add sources to an import file in `bash/`
    [ ] Seperate function files into seperate directories
      Based on what the function does?
